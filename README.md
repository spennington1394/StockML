# Machine Learning Model for Predicting Stocks

The goal of this project was to produce a machine learning model that can be used by any individual seeking to take advantage of the stock market from home. Scikit Learn, TensorFlow, and Python were used within a Jupyter Notebook to develop a Sequential, Deep-learning model, using Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) cells. There are a variety of paramters that can be changed by the user to change both the scope and accuracy of the predictions. Results from runnning the model are also currently being hosted on a website, developed to later hold an iteration of our model for even easier use by the public. The data the model runs on is scraped from Yahoo Finance's website and any known ticker symbol can be input to generate predictions. If you have any questions regarding how the model works or how you can access this code to run it from your own machine, please feel free to reach out to brianroberts778@gmail.com.
